# GraphTransform Framework

A principled approach to multi-agent simulation using category theory, functional programming, and JAX acceleration.

## Core Principles

GraphTransform is built on foundational mathematical and computational principles that provide a rigorous basis for modeling complex multi-agent systems.

### From Category Theory to Code

At its heart, GraphTransform implements category theory concepts directly in code:

- **Morphisms as Pure Functions**: Transformations are morphisms in the category of graph states
- **Composition as a First-Class Operation**: Sequential and parallel composition of transformations
- **Invariant Preservation**: Transformations can be characterized by the properties they preserve
- **Type Safety**: Mathematical properties encoded in the type system

This category-theoretic foundation enables us to reason about transformations mathematically while implementing them computationally.

### Functional Paradigm

The framework embraces functional programming principles:

- **Immutability**: Graph states are immutable, transformations produce new states
- **Pure Functions**: Transformations have no side effects
- **Function Composition**: Complex behaviors built from simple composable parts
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Transformations that operate on other transformations
- **Referential Transparency**: Identical inputs always produce identical outputs

### The Two-Layer Architecture

GraphTransform separates **what** happens from **how** it happens through a clean two-layer architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Process Layer (Mathematical Definition)                             │
│                                                                     │
│  • Graph transformations as typed, composable operations            │
│  • Mathematical properties encoded and verified                     │
│  • Algebraic laws governing composition                             │
│  • Scale-independent, platform-independent definitions              │
└───────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┘
                                │

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Execution Layer (Computational Implementation)                      │
│                                                                     │
│  • Optimization of computational resources                          │
│  • Hardware-specific acceleration (JAX)                             │
│  • Service integration (LLMs, storage)                              │
│  • Performance monitoring and adaptation                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This separation ensures mathematical rigor while enabling computational efficiency.

## Conceptual Framework

### Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down Processes

The framework distinguishes between two fundamental classes of transformations:

**Bottom-Up Communication**:
- Agent-to-agent interactions
- Information generation and exchange
- Belief updating through local interactions
- Emergent patterns from local rules

**Top-Down Regularization**:
- Global coordination mechanisms
- Constraint enforcement
- Collective decision-making
- Resource allocation systems

This distinction mirrors how complex systems in nature operate: local interactions produce emergent behaviors, while global constraints shape the overall system dynamics.

### Graph Monads

The core data structure is the `GraphState`, which functions as a monad in the category-theoretic sense:

- It encapsulates a complete system state
- It provides operations for transformation
- It maintains immutability
- It enables composition of operations

This monad-based approach gives us a mathematically sound way to represent and transform complex system states.

### Key Components

#### Core Layer

- **GraphState**: Immutable representation of a graph with node attributes, adjacency matrices, and global attributes
- **Property**: First-class representation of invariants that can be verified on graph states
- **Category**: Functions for composition and transformation of graph states

#### Transformation Layer

- **Bottom-Up**: Pure functions for agent-to-agent communication and belief updating
- **Top-Down**: Pure functions for global coordination mechanisms like voting and markets

#### Services Layer

- External service interfaces (LLMs, storage, etc.)
- Clean boundaries between pure transformations and impure services

#### Implementations Layer

- Adapters connecting pure transformations to external services
- Pre-configured simulations combining multiple transformations

## JAX Integration

GraphTransform uses JAX to accelerate computations while maintaining functional purity:

- **JIT Compilation**: Transformations can be JIT-compiled for performance
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Transformations can be differentiated for gradient-based analyses
- **Vectorization**: Batch processing of transformations across multiple states
- **GPU/TPU Acceleration**: Transformations run efficiently on accelerated hardware

The functional paradigm aligns perfectly with JAX's design philosophy, enabling seamless integration.

## Practical Use Cases

GraphTransform is designed for modeling complex multi-agent systems including:

- **Collective Intelligence**: How groups make decisions and process information
- **Market Dynamics**: Trading, pricing, and resource allocation
- **Social Networks**: Information diffusion and belief formation
- **Democratic Systems**: Voting mechanisms and delegation patterns
- **Institutional Design**: Testing mechanisms for robust governance

## Development Principles

1. **Functional Core, Imperative Shell**: Pure transformations in the core, service dependencies isolated in adapters

2. **Dependency Inversion**: Transformations define interfaces that services fulfill, rather than depending directly on services

3. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Systems built by composing smaller, well-defined transformations

4. **Typed Interfaces**: Clear type signatures for all transformations and compositions

5. **Property-Based Testing**: Testing transformations based on the properties they preserve

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of defining and composing transformations:

```python
# Define transformations
info_transform = lambda state: information_transform(state, info_generator)
belief_updater = lambda state: belief_update_transform(state, belief_update_function)
market = trading_transform

# Compose into a simulation step
simulation_step = sequential(
    info_transform,     # Generate information
    belief_updater,     # Update beliefs
    market              # Execute trades
)

# Apply to graph state
result = simulation_step(initial_state)
```

To use with LLM services:

```python
# Initialize LLM service
llm_service = OpenAIService(api_key, model)

# Create LLM-based belief updater through adapter
belief_updater = create_llm_belief_updater(llm_service)

# Use in composition as before
simulation_step = sequential(info_transform, belief_updater, market)
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install graph-transform
```
