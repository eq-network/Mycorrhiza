# Graph Transformation Framework - Fruit Preference Voting Simulation

This project implements a modular framework for multi-agent simulations based on graph transformations. It includes a demonstration application simulating agents discussing and voting on fruit preferences.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into modules:

- **core/**: Fundamental components for graph state and transformations
- **models/**: Domain-specific data models 
- **transformations/**: Implementations of specific transformations
- **services/**: External integrations (LLM clients, visualization)
- **simulations/**: Orchestration of simulation scenarios
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests

## Running the Simulation

Simply run the main files inside of the graph transformation folder to test it out.
