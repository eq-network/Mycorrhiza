"""The scenario registry — the per-scenario extension point.

A ``ScenarioSpec`` binds an environment to its benchmarked conditions and its
influence instrument. The influence *definition* is per-scenario (each names its
human-preference channel, outcome, and counterfactual design) but always causal —
paired same-key rollouts, never correlational scores alone:

- ``governed_commons``: init-state preference shift (``collective_influence``) — do the
  households' asks govern realized harvests over the run?
- ``compute_economy``: **labor dependence NOW** (``intervention_elasticity``,
  work-pref shift at 2T/3) — does the economy still respond to human labor choices
  AFTER the AI capital stock has entrenched? An init-state shift would measure
  dependence-from-birth, which stays ≈1 even in the captured economy (early labor is
  upstream of the capital stock itself); the gap between the two IS the
  gradual-disempowerment signature. Relabeled from "influence" 2026-07-24: the
  substrate has no governance channel, so its instrument measures how much the economy
  still *needs* people, not whether they govern it (docs/model-register-design.md §2).

Adding a scenario = build the env (EXTENDING.md), then one ``ScenarioSpec`` here.
