# Functional Test Specification: Graph Transformation System

## Introduction

This document outlines the functional validation strategy for the Graph Transformation System, prioritizing end-state tests that validate system behavior and capabilities. These tests are designed to confirm that the system correctly implements the mathematical framework described in "A Langlands Program for Collective Intelligence" while providing the practical foundation necessary for modeling democratic decision-making mechanisms.

## Validation Principles

The testing strategy adheres to these core principles:
- **Behavior-Oriented**: Tests validate observable system behavior rather than implementation details
- **Property-Preserving**: Tests verify mathematical invariants are maintained through transformations
- **Composition-Focused**: Tests confirm correct behavior of composed transformations
- **Boundary-Respecting**: Tests validate separation between process definition and execution
