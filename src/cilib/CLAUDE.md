# Engine conventions (src/cilib)

Load-bearing rules for all engine code. The root ethos applies; these are the
JAX/state specifics that prevent real failures.

- **State lives in `GraphState`, not in objects.** Agents are pure factories; the
  evolving arrays live in `node_attrs` / `adj_matrices`. Don't add stateful classes.
- **Static config is closed over by transform factories, never stored in
  `global_attrs`.** `global_attrs` is static pytree aux — swept/per-step data there
  forces recompiles. `GraphState` carries only *evolving* arrays.
- **No data-dependent Python control flow inside transforms.** Replace `if traced:`
  with `jnp.where` / `lax.cond` (e.g. `core.category.gated`) so it traces under
  `lax.scan`.
- **Pure tier vs eager tier.** Pure (`core.scan`) is the default and the only tier
  that `vmap`s over seeds. Use the eager tier (`core.time`) *only* for genuinely
  effectful agents (LLM/HTTP).
- **Transforms declare `.reads` / `.writes`** via `@transform` so `compile_pipeline`
  can derive order. Same-family mechanisms keep disjoint writes.
- **The trajectory is the memory ceiling, not the state.** Raw per-agent traces cost
  O(T·N) — ~3000× the state at N≥500 — and no metric in this repo needs the joint
  (T, N) array. Reduce the *agent* axis in `trace_fn` (a (T,) scalar series is
  ~8 KB and worth keeping); fold per-agent or long-window quantities with a
  `metrics/reducers.py` `Reducer` via `EnvSpec.run_reduced` — O(1) carry, same
  number to float32 rounding. `examples/08_streaming_metrics.py` measures the gap.
- **One shared mathematical object = one piece of code.** A kernel asserted
  equivalent across environments is factored (see `environments/attachment.py`) or
  held equal by a bit-identity test — never by a comment.
- **Simplicity is a hard requirement.** Short, inspectable code; deletion over new
  abstraction; a catalog readable in one screen beats a clever registry framework.
- Assumptions cards (`ASSUMPTIONS.md` beside an environment) follow the prose rules
  in `docs/CLAUDE.md`.
