"""
Streaming reduction over a run — folding metrics INTO the scan instead of after it.

``run_scan`` stacks ``trace_fn(state)`` into arrays with a leading time axis, and
every metric in this library then scores that stacked trace. That decomposition
is an *unfused* ``unfold ; fold``: it materializes O(T x trace) bytes so a fold
can walk them once and return, usually, a single float. The cost is not
incidental — it is the binding constraint on long or large runs:

    value_contagion, N=5000, 16 seeds, T=2000
        sparse `friendship` in the state ......   0.45 MB
        stacked trace .........................   1.28 GB     (~2800x the state)

    io_economy traces `technical`, an (N, N) matrix, EVERY step -> O(T * N^2),
        while its `spectral_margin` metric reads only the final slice.

A ``Reducer`` is the fused form: an accumulator living in the scan carry, so the
memory cost is O(accumulator) rather than O(T x trace). Same arithmetic, same
answer, no time axis retained.

    Reducer ::= { init     : (state0, T)        -> acc
                  update   : (acc, state, t, T) -> acc
                  finalize : (acc, T)           -> value }

``T`` (the step count) is threaded through all three because it is a static
Python int at trace time and window reducers need it — ``late_mean`` has to know
where the last quarter of the run begins. ``t`` is the traced scan index, so
``update`` must be branch-free in it (use ``jnp.where``, not ``if``).

**This does not replace tracing.** Reducing over the AGENT axis is what saves
memory; the time axis for a scalar is 8 KB at T=2000. So keep emitting cheap
(T,) scalar series through ``trace_fn`` — timelines, onset detection and the
window regressions all need them — and use reducers for anything whose natural
readout is per-agent or whose window is long. ``run_scan_reduce`` returns both.

Replay note: the scan tier is pure and seeded, so a rollout is bit-reproducible
from its key. A metric you did not declare up front is recoverable *exactly* by
re-running with a different reducer — it just costs another run. That is why
reducing hard is safe here: nothing has to be recorded "just in case".

    """A fold over the states of one run, accumulated in the scan carry.

    A reducer folds over exactly the ``T`` states that ``trace_fn`` would record
    — the states AFTER each round — so that its result matches the trace-based
    metric it replaces. ``init`` therefore has to return an **identity element**
    (zero for a sum, ``-inf`` for a max), never ``readout(initial_state)``:
    seeding with a real value folds over ``T + 1`` states and quietly includes
    the pre-run state the trace never sees.

    Args:
        init: ``(initial_state, n_steps) -> acc``. Builds the identity
            accumulator; the state is passed for its SHAPES and dtypes, not its
            values. The accumulator is part of the scan carry, so it must be
            shape-stable like any other carry.
        update: ``(acc, state, t, n_steps) -> acc``, called with the state AFTER
            each round. ``t`` is traced: no Python branching on it.
        finalize: ``(acc, n_steps) -> value``, called once on the final
            accumulator. This is where a running sum becomes a mean, or an
            accumulated per-agent vector becomes a Gini coefficient.
