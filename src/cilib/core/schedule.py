"""
Schedule primitive — map clock ticks to active transforms.

From the whitepaper §3.3: the Schedule is a global clock that ticks at a
base rate, with each transform assigned a cadence c_i and optional phase
offset φ_i. Transform τ_i fires at tick t if and only if (t - φ_i) mod c_i == 0.

This makes the timescale structure of a mechanism design explicit and
experimentally controllable. The schedule itself is a first-class
experimental variable.
