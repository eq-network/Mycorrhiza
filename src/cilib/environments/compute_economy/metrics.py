"""
Evaluation suite for the Compute Economy — the seven mainline indicators.

Each metric scores a single run's trace (time axis 0); ``jax.vmap`` over the seed axis
for batches. ``labor_share`` (mean wage-bill share of output) is the scenario's
dependence-decay curve and the counterfactual-influence outcome; ``human_income_share``
additionally captures redistribution defenses (transfers reach households without
passing through the wage bill).

Caveat (documented, consistent across conditions): ``income_gini``/``income_hhi`` are
computed over ALL N nodes including not-yet-arrived AI slots as zero-income entries, so
absolute values run high early in a run; relative comparisons across conditions with the
same ``n_ai_slots`` are valid.
