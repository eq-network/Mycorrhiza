"""
Metrics for the Coupled Society — per-domain human shares, their joint decline,
and the defense-transfer-gap instrument (the leaderboard's headline number).

Per-domain vital signs (each late-run mean, the ``_late`` idiom):

- ``human_income_share`` economy: who the income actually goes to (sees rents;
  the composite's economy leg). ``labor_share`` (wage·L/Y) is kept as the
  classical factor-share readout, blind to rule-capture by construction.
- ``human_culture_share`` culture: humans still holding human-origin culture
- ``human_influence_share`` politics: citizens' total consensus weight
- ``composite_human_share``: their mean — the single "how are the humans
  doing across the whole society" number.
- ``correlated_decline``: mean pairwise Pearson correlation of the three
  human-share time series — the alpha plan's correlated-decline index (near 0
  when domains move independently; near 1 under joint lock-in).

``defense_transfer_gap`` is NOT a trace metric — it is the paired-twin
instrument (counterfactual.py's same-key pattern): run the SAME defenses in
the coupled env and its ``kappa = 0`` twin with the same key, difference the
composite. At kappa = 0 the twin is bit-identical, so the gap is exactly 0 by
construction — the instrument's null is built in.
