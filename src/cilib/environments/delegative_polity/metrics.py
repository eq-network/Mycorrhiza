"""
Metrics for Delegative Polity — the concentration curve, the tracking readout,
and where the tax money went.

All score a single run's trace (time axis 0) with the ``_late`` idiom (mean
over the last quarter — steadier than the final tick); ``jax.vmap`` over the
seed axis for batches.

- ``human_power_share``: total power held by citizens. The headline — in the
  undefended captured run it collapses; defenses restore it.
- ``influence_gini`` / ``centralization`` / ``top_delegate_share``: how
  concentrated delegated voice has become, over ALL nodes (the liquid-democracy
  super-voter readouts — concentration is organic before any AI advantage).
- ``policy_median_gap``: |enacted rate − citizen median ideal| — Black's
  theorem as a residual (0 = the polity tracks its median voter).
- ``decision_quality``: |enacted rate − true_rate| — the epistemic-democracy
  reading (dispersed voice averages preference noise away; power concentrated
  on the biased reservoir drags policy toward ``ai_bias``).
- ``enforcement_level``: rule in practice — the lock-in readout.
- ``wealth_gini``: final-tick citizen wealth inequality — policy capture,
  measured in citizens' pockets (captured ai_bias=0 halts redistribution, so
  wealth inequality stays at endowment inequality).
