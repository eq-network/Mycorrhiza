"""
Evaluation suite for the Governed Commons, bound to the trajectory trace.

Each metric scores a *single run's* trace (time axis = 0); for a batch, ``jax.vmap`` the
metric (or ``EnvSpec.evaluate``) over the leading seed axis.

``influence_fidelity`` is the scenario's influence readout — the building block the
benchmark's ``influence_preserved`` score (``cilib.lab.analysis.influence``) normalizes
against the undefended baseline. It measures *realized outcomes* against the principal's
ask, in units of that ask:

    fidelity = mean( 1 - clip(|last_harvest - principal_pref| / principal_pref, 0, 1) )

so it is ~0 both while misaligned delegates over-harvest several times the ask AND after
the stock collapses to nothing — both are states where the principal's will does not
govern outcomes. (Deliberately NOT based on ``delegate_action``: v0 delegates don't
learn, so no mechanism moves their desires — what mechanisms move is what's *realized*.)
