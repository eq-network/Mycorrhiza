"""
Metrics for Influence Exchange — the concentration curve and the wisdom readout.

All four score a single run's trace (time axis 0) with the ``_late`` idiom
(mean over the last quarter — steadier than the final tick); ``jax.vmap`` over
the seed axis for batches.

- ``human_influence_share``: total influence held by citizens. The headline —
  in the undefended amplified run it collapses; defenses restore it.
- ``influence_gini`` / ``centralization``: the A4 mainline indicators — how
  concentrated attention has become, over ALL nodes (organic preferential
  attachment concentrates within humans too; that's the pre-AI baseline).
- ``consensus_error``: |mean citizen opinion − truth| (truth = 0 by
  convention). Dispersed influence averages initial noise away (Golub-Jackson
  wisdom); influence concentrated on the biased AI reservoir drags consensus
  toward ``ai_bias`` — the wisdom condition breaking, as a number.
