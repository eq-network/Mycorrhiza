"""
Metrics for the IO Economy — the demand-attribution decomposition and its companions.

The headline is the standard IO attribution (Miller & Blair): activity ultimately
driven by human final demand is ``x_H = (I−A)⁻¹ d_H``, and the **human demand share**
is ``1ᵀx_H / 1ᵀ(I−A)⁻¹(d_H + d_AI)`` — "what fraction of the economy still runs for
people". Because the substrate's fixed point IS the Leontief solution, this metric is
exact accounting, not an estimate; hypothetical extraction (drop ``d_H``, read the
output loss) is the same algebra, which is what makes the counterfactual instrument
analytically checkable here (the register's rung for ``environments/counterfactual.py``).

``spectral_margin`` = 1 − ρ(A) is the distance to the reproduction boundary of the
intermediate loop — under labor→cognition substitution at cost parity, column sums
climb toward 1, so the margin closes BY the accounting identity (the diagnostics
thread's operator, here as the model itself rather than a linearization). Power
iteration, not ``eigvals``: A is nonnegative, so the Perron root is the limit of the
iteration norm, and it stays backend-agnostic under ``vmap``.
