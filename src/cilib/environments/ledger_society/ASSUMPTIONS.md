# ledger_society — assumptions card

**What this says a society is.** One population holding three conserved stocks —
money, attention, ballots — where every form of cross-domain influence is either
spending one stock to move another or a declared read of a collective variable.
The same attachment kernel reallocates attention and ballots; disempowerment, if
it occurs, is the three human shares draining toward whoever accumulates and
spends fastest.

**Assumptions.**

- Three ledgers with explicit contracts (`state.LEDGERS`): money is minted by
  production and leaves through consume/invest/broadcast/lobby (declared sinks —
  goods, machines, and the influence industry are outside the modeled loop);
  attention and ballots are pure per-row reallocation, floored by
  `self_weight_w` / `self_weight_d`. The ladder asserts all three every run.
- Three coupling channels, one dial each, all value-agnostic (no `node_types`
  test in any channel): `reach_per_spend` (money→attention, multiplicative
  bought reach, linear and unsaturated — a critic should press here),
  `attention_to_ballots` (culture→politics, a port read into delegation
  attractiveness), `regime_rate` (money→rules: lobby spend moves enforcement,
  direction set endogenously by the sign of each spender's net redistribution
  transfer). Each is exactly neutral at 0; the three dials are the knockout axes.
- The economy leg is a REDUCED WP1, not the full `capital_economy`: two-factor
  production with an automation share `a = eK/(eK+H)`, no IO backbone, no upkeep
  settlement, consumption as a sink rather than a demand loop. The conservation
  discipline is kept; the circular flow is not. Forks wanting the full flow
  start from `capital_economy` (its card colocates there).
- Type-referencing that remains is substrate, not coupling, each instance
  deliberate: humans hold the labor slot; the tax payout goes to citizens
  (the franchise as an institution); AI kernel rows are frozen and AI belief is
  pinned (the reservoir idiom, inherited from influence_exchange); AI delegates
  carry `ai_ballot`. Asymmetry of behavior lives in default allocation
  *policies* (`human_alloc` / `ai_alloc`) — the agnosticism rungs swap them.
- The threat is a schedule plus a strategy: AI actors arrive with seed capital
  (title minted, declared) and allocate toward invest/broadcast/lobby. There is
  no persuasive-content advantage and no amplification multiplier — reach is
  only ever bought.
- Kernel exponents default to γ=1 (share-neutral organic attachment,
  Krapivsky–Redner) — the honest baseline; capability growth
  (`growth_rate`, saturating at `e_ceiling`) is the only compounding source.
- `entrenchment_gain` defaults 0: the WP3 lock-in channel exists but is off —
  any regime erosion at defaults is funded lobbying, not concentration.
- Absent: a demand loop (consumption sinks), a state actor with a budget,
  belief→economy coupling (v0's `converts_capitalize` has no analog yet),
  defense-mechanism wiring (`cap_scale` seams), churn in the attention kernel,
  and any schedule separation between domains (lockstep only in v1).

**Classical result reproduced.** Not one theorem — three contract identities on
every run: per-tick money conservation (Δtotal = mint − sinks), row-stochasticity
of both adjacency ledgers, ballot shares summing to 1; plus the sealing
identity — with the three dials at 0, an economy-dial change leaves
belief/attention/power trajectories BIT-IDENTICAL under the same key
(`tests/test_ladder.py`).

**The dial(s).** The three channel gains jointly; ladder facts at defaults
(seeds 4, T=300, committed as ordering only per house rules): coupled composite
< sealed composite; no-arrivals human income share > 0.9 and power share > 0.6;
humans buying reach gain attention share when the channel is isolated — at
defaults the same purchase is outspent 10–40× by AI budgets, which is the
dynamic under study, not an artifact.

**Instrument.** Sealed twins via the three dials (same key); per-dial sealing is
the edge-knockout design (docs/ledger-design.md §6) — the measured coupling
matrix and its ρ(A) are the follow-up, not yet built.

**Lineage.** The GD-suite product construction (docs/gd-suite-v0.1.md §4):
reduced `capital_economy` economy leg; `influence_exchange` attention/belief
idioms; `delegative_polity` ballot/vote/regime idioms with
`mechanisms/democracy.py` reused verbatim; both adjacency ledgers driven by
`environments/attachment.py` (the shared kernel's first single-home use).
Replaces `coupled_society`'s κ-modulations with spends and port reads; the
invariance run against that baseline is the exit criterion for headline claims.

**Status.** Live v1 (2026-07-30, this deposit): 8-rung ladder passing.
Not in the benchmark; not in suite v0.1 (candidate for its `coupled` slot at
v0.2 after the invariance run). Referee paragraph: the linear unsaturated reach
channel makes late-run AI attention dominance partly a functional-form choice;
the consumption sink severs WP1's demand-attribution logic (an economy that no
longer needs human spending cannot be detected here); and the flywheel ordering
at defaults rests on hand-set channel gains — sign only, no magnitudes, until
the swept phase maps and the coupled_society invariance run exist.
