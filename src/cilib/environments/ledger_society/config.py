"""
Config for the Ledger Society — the GD suite's shared model (coupled rewrite v1).

One population, three conserved ledgers, one attachment kernel used twice:

- **money** (``wealth``): minted by production, split by the automation share,
  spent through an allocation vector — consume / invest / broadcast / lobby /
  save. Influence over other domains is SPENDING, never a free modulation.
- **attention** (``listening`` rows): reallocated by the shared kernel;
  broadcast spend buys attractiveness (``reach_per_spend`` — the money→attention
  channel, replacing v0's ``economic_power_buys_persuasion``).
- **ballots** (``delegation`` rows): reallocated by the shared kernel + churn;
  delegation attractiveness reads attention influence
  (``attention_to_ballots`` — the culture→politics channel, a port read).
  The power-weighted median sets a tax; lobbying spend moves ``regime``
  (money→rules, replacing v0's free ``politics_rewrites_market_rules``).

Value-agnosticism (docs/ledger-design.md §3): NO coupling channel tests
``node_types``. Asymmetry lives only where it honestly belongs — arrival
schedules (AI actors arrive with seed capital) and default allocation
*policies* (who chooses to spend on influence). A human with an AI-style
allocation buys reach identically; an AI actor that never spends captures
nothing. Both are ladder rungs.

Sealing (the v0 instrument, relocated): with the three channel dials at zero
and influence allocations zero, the economy cannot move culture or politics —
a same-key economy-dial change leaves ``listening``/``delegation``/``belief``
bit-identical (in-pipeline sealing, same discipline as coupled_society's rung).

Parameter typing (house rule): anchored / tuned-for-legibility /
arbitrary-but-swept, marked per field.
