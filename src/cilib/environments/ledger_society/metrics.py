"""
Metrics for the Ledger Society — one human share per ledger, their composite,
and the rules readouts. All score a single run's trace (time axis 0);
``jax.vmap`` over seeds.

Two scoring windows, same quantities:

- **late** (the ``_late`` idiom, mean over the last quarter) — the original.
  It reads a near-equilibrium value, which is what makes it the window least
  sensitive to *when* a player or policy acted.
- **journey** (``journey_*``, mean over the whole run) — the area under the
  share curve: what the population actually lived through, tick by tick.

The distinction is load-bearing for the GD game (docs/gd-game-dynamics-review.md
§2b, decision 2026-07-31: the game scores the entire journey, because
the player's choices are meant to matter). Probed the same day on harbor dials,
8 seeds, medians, no CIs — ordering claim only: comparing one intervention
enacted early against the same intervention enacted late, the late-window
window reports a difference of +0.014 where the journey window reports +0.045.
Same runs, same model; only the window differs. Neither window is more correct
in general — late answers "where did it end up", journey answers "what was it
like to live there" — but a claim about timing belongs in the journey window.
