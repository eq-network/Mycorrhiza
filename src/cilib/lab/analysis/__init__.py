"""
Cross-paradigm measurement tier — pure, ``GraphState``-free analysis functions.

These are fed recorded histories / operators (not simulation state) and return scalars,
mirroring the stance of ``engine/environments/commons_metrics.py``. The simulation tier
(``core.scan`` + paradigm transforms) produces trajectories; this tier measures them.

Currently:
- ``effective_information`` — Hoel/Klein–Hoel EI, coarse-graining, lumpability leak (JAX kernel).
- ``causal_emergence`` — offline pipeline (numpy float64): T construction (structural/behavioral),
  TPM estimator, partitions (nested/agglomerative/greedy-modularity), null test, Shapley-EI,
  and the synthetic reference network (validation fixture).
