Spectral metrics: graph-Laplacian structure readouts (minimal C0 slice).

The cultural register (docs/cultural-register-design.md §8, §11) pulls a
spectral family forward as phase C0: generic readouts for any environment that
carries an agent-agent adjacency, the *measurement dual* of the separation dial
— you set homophily on the generator, you read partition alignment here. This
module is the minimal slice: ``fiedler_partition_alignment`` only, the detector
for "is the graph's primary fault line the human/AI boundary?". The rest of the
family (spectral-gap ratio, current-flow mediation shares) lands with A4.

Eigenvector SIGNS are arbitrary (any eigensolver may flip them), so alignment
compares induced *partitions*, never vectors: the |phi coefficient| (absolute
Matthews correlation) between the Fiedler sign-split of ``L = D − W`` and the
node-type split. Chance baseline ≈ 0 even under heavy type imbalance (a
matching-fraction score would baseline at ``max(n_h, n_ai)/n``); 1 exactly when
the splits coincide up to relabeling; 0 on degenerate one-sided splits (the
denominator guard). Disconnected graphs have λ₂ = 0 and no meaningful Fiedler
partition — keep generator homophily below 1.0.

All functions stay in jnp (``jnp.linalg.eigh`` traces and vmaps).
