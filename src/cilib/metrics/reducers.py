"""
Reducer catalog — the fold shapes this library's metrics actually use.

Built by surveying every metric across the eight environments. The result was
narrower than expected: **not one of them needs the joint ``(T, N)`` array.**
They are four shapes, and each has an exact streaming form:

    metric shape                        example                              reducer
    ----------------------------------  -----------------------------------  ---------------------
    final state only                    ``trace["output"][-1]``              (read ``finals``)
    scalar per step, full series         ``late_log_output`` regressions      (keep in ``trace_fn``)
    per-agent vector reduced over time  ``gini_of(sum(reward, axis=0))``     ``per_agent_total``
    scalar reduced over both axes        ``human_origin_share``               ``late_mean``

So the ``(T, N)`` materialization every ``default_trace`` performs is not paying
for anything a metric reads — it is an artifact of tracing raw and reducing
afterwards. These reducers close that gap: same arithmetic, O(1) or O(N) carry.

Each entry takes a ``readout: GraphState -> value`` and returns a
``core.reduce.Reducer``. Readouts must be pure and branch-free (they run inside
``lax.scan``).

    from cilib.core.reduce import run_scan_reduce
    from cilib.metrics.reducers import late_mean, per_agent_total

    reducers = {"share": late_mean(lambda s: jnp.mean(1.0 - s.node_attrs["culture"]))}
    finals, trace, reduced = run_scan_reduce(round_fn, s0, 2000, key, reducers)

**Exactness.** A streaming mean sums in a different order than ``jnp.mean`` over
a materialized block, so reducer results match their trace-based twins to
float32 rounding (~1e-7 relative), NOT bit-for-bit. Unlike the sparse-adjacency
swap, ``allclose`` is the honest assertion here. Nothing downstream thresholds
these values, so the difference does not amplify.
