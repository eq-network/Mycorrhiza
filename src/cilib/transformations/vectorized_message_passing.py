"""
Vectorized message passing — the scan-tier counterpart to message_passing.py.

``message_passing.create_message_passing_transform`` is the EAGER form: a Python
loop over ``int(i)`` node indices, building ``Dict[str, Any]`` messages. It is
flexible (heterogeneous, typed packets) but host-syncs per node, so it cannot run
inside ``jit``/``lax.scan``.

This module is the PURE form for the scan tier: message passing expressed as
matrix ops over a named adjacency, so it compiles and ``vmap``s. The workhorse is
trust-weighted aggregation, which is exactly information-form belief fusion
("precision-weighted averaging on a trust graph", DeGroot in information form):

    new[i] = sum_j  W[i, j] * attr[j]          # W = adj_matrices[connection_type]

implemented as ``jnp.einsum('ij,j...->i...', W, attr)`` so it works for any
trailing attribute shape: a potential ``h`` of shape ``(N, d)``, a precision
``Pi`` of shape ``(N, d, d)``, candidate stacks ``(N, K, d, d)``, etc.

Memory is the self-loop: if ``W`` has a positive diagonal, each node mixes in its
own previous value, so an isolated node (only its self-edge) simply carries its
belief forward.

``W`` may be a ``BCOO`` (see ``environments/networks.to_sparse``), in which case
aggregation runs at edge cost instead of O(N²). **Sparse support is rank-1 only**
for now: ``einsum`` has no BCOO path for arbitrary trailing shapes, so a sparse
``W`` with a ``(N, d)`` or ``(N, d, d)`` attribute raises rather than silently
densifying. Higher-rank sparse fusion — the ``Pi`` precision-matrix case — is the
follow-on, and wants ``sparse.bcoo_dot_general`` rather than this dispatch.
